        <p>
          I'm a self-motivated web developer with a strong focus on creating elegant, high-performing websites and web apps.
          My journey in web development began with curiosity and turned into a passion for clean code, responsive design,
          and solving real-world problems through technology. I enjoy working with both frontend and backend technologies,
          always aiming to learn more and build better. Whether itâ€™s a portfolio, e-commerce site, or custom app, I approach
          every project with creativity and precision.
